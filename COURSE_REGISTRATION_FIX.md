# Course Registration Fix Summary

## Problem Diagnosed
The course registration and update functionality was failing with the error:
```
üîß Server action started { hasData: false, isUpdate: false, dataKeys: [] }
‚ùå No data provided to courseRegistration
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in how the `useAction` hook was being used with the server action. The server action signature is:
```typescript
export async function courseRegistration(
  prevState: StateType,
  data: TCourse | undefined | null
): Promise<StateType>
```

However, the `useAction` hook wrapping was causing the data to not be passed correctly to the server action when called through `action(data)`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Direct Server Action Call
Changed from using the `useAction` hook wrapper to directly calling the server action:

**Before:**
```typescript
const { action, reset } = useAction(courseRegistration, ...);
// ...
const result = await action(data);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const result = await courseRegistration({ status: false, cause: "", message: "" }, data);
```

### 2. Manual Toast Notifications
Since we removed the `useAction` hook, we now manually handle toast notifications using `sonner`:

```typescript
const loadingToast = toast.loading("Creating course...");

try {
  // Process video, call server action
  const result = await courseRegistration(...);
  
  toast.dismiss(loadingToast);
  
  if (result.status) {
    toast.success("Course created successfully!");
    router.push(`/${lang}/course`);
  } else {
    toast.error("Failed to create course", {
      description: result.message || result.cause
    });
  }
} catch (error) {
  toast.dismiss(loadingToast);
  toast.error("An unexpected error occurred");
}
```

### 3. Removed Unused Code
- Removed `useAction` import
- Removed `useAction` hook initialization
- Removed unused `pathname` variable and `usePathname` import

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`app/[lang]/@manager/course/registration/[[...id]]/page.tsx`**
   - Added `import { toast } from "sonner";`
   - Removed `import useAction from "@/hooks/useAction";`
   - Removed `import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";`
   - Removed `useAction` hook initialization
   - Updated `handleFormSubmit` to:
     - Call server action directly with proper parameters
     - Show loading toast during processing
     - Show success/error toasts based on result
     - Navigate to course list on success
     - Reset form state on success
   - Removed unused `pathname` variable

## Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **Direct Control**: Direct server action calls provide better control over the flow
2. ‚úÖ **Better Debugging**: Easier to debug since we can see exactly what data is being passed
3. ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support without wrapper abstraction
4. ‚úÖ **Custom Handling**: Can customize success/error handling per form
5. ‚úÖ **No State Sync Issues**: No need to sync between hook state and component state

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new course
- [ ] Update an existing course
- [ ] Verify video upload works
- [ ] Verify thumbnail upload works
- [ ] Verify form validation works
- [ ] Verify toast notifications appear correctly
- [ ] Verify navigation after successful creation/update
- [ ] Verify error handling and error toasts
- [ ] Check database to ensure course is created/updated with correct data

## Expected Behavior

### Creating a Course:
1. Fill in all required fields
2. Click "Create Course" button
3. See loading toast: "Creating course..."
4. Video chunks uploaded if video selected
5. Server action called with complete course data
6. On success:
   - Toast: "Course created successfully!"
   - Navigate to course list after 500ms
7. On error:
   - Toast: "Failed to create course" with error description

### Updating a Course:
1. Open existing course for editing
2. Modify fields
3. Click "Update Course" button
4. See loading toast: "Updating course..."
5. Video chunks uploaded if new video selected
6. Server action called with updated course data
7. On success:
   - Toast: "Course updated successfully!"
   - Navigate to course list after 500ms
8. On error:
   - Toast: "Failed to update course" with error description
