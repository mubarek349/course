# Student Dashboard Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the student dashboard with real-time data fetching, progress tracking, and analytics.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Backend Actions (`actions/student/dashboard.ts`)

Complete server-side functions for fetching student dashboard data.

#### Functions Implemented:

##### `getDashboardData()`

**Purpose:** Fetches comprehensive statistics for the student dashboard.

**Returns:**

```typescript
{
  totalCourses: number; // Total enrolled courses (paid)
  coursesInProgress: number; // Courses with 0 < progress < 100
  completedCourses: number; // Courses with 100% completion
  certificatesEarned: number; // Completed courses with certificate enabled
}
```

**Logic:**

- Fetches all paid orders for the logged-in user
- Calculates progress by comparing completed vs total sub-activities
- Categorizes courses into: in progress, completed
- Counts certificates for completed courses with certificate enabled

---

##### `getGraphData()`

**Purpose:** Fetches detailed course progress data for visualization.

**Returns:**

```typescript
Array<{
  id: string;
  titleEn: string;
  titleAm: string;
  thumbnail: string;
  progress: number; // 0-100 percentage
  totalSubActivities: number;
  completedSubActivities: number;
  category: string; // Course level: beginner/intermediate/advanced
}>;
```

**Logic:**

- Fetches all enrolled courses with activities and sub-activities
- Calculates progress percentage based on studentProgress records
- Returns detailed course information for charting

---

##### `getContinueLearning()`

**Purpose:** Gets courses that are currently in progress (not completed).

**Returns:**

- Array of courses with 0 < progress < 100
- Sorted by progress (ascending) - shows least progressed courses first
- Helps students pick up where they left off

---

##### `getAllEnrolledCourses()`

**Purpose:** Gets all enrolled courses (both in progress and completed).

**Returns:**

- All enrolled courses with their progress
- Sorted by progress (descending) - shows most completed courses first
- Useful for displaying complete course history

---

### 2. Dashboard Page (`app/[lang]/@student/dashboard/page.tsx`)

Main dashboard page converted to server component for optimal performance.

**Key Features:**

- Server-side rendering for faster initial load
- Parallel data fetching using `Promise.all()`
- Bilingual support (English/Amharic)
- Responsive grid layout
- Real-time statistics display

**Data Flow:**

1. Authenticate user session
2. Fetch all dashboard data in parallel
3. Transform data for UI components
4. Render with bilingual labels

---

### 3. Dashboard Chart Component (`app/[lang]/@student/dashboard/components/DashboardChart.tsx`)

Client component for interactive progress visualization using Recharts.

**Features:**

- Bar chart showing progress for all enrolled courses
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design
- Custom tooltips
- Handles empty state gracefully

**Props:**

```typescript
{
  data: Array<{
    name: string; // Course title (truncated)
    Progress: number; // 0-100 percentage
  }>;
}
```

---

### 4. Continue Learning List Component (`app/[lang]/@student/dashboard/components/ContinueLearningList.tsx`)

Client component displaying courses in progress with visual progress bars.

**Features:**

- Interactive course cards with hover effects
- Progress bars with percentage display
- Lesson completion count (e.g., "5 / 20 lessons completed")
- Direct links to course pages
- Empty state with helpful message
- Bilingual support

**Props:**

```typescript
{
  courses: CourseProgress[];
  lang: string;  // 'en' | 'am'
}
```

---

## Database Schema Utilization

### Tables Used:

1. **Order**

   - Filters: `status: "paid"` (only paid enrollments)
   - Gets user's enrolled courses

2. **Course**

   - Includes: activity, instructor details
   - Provides course metadata (title, thumbnail, certificate status)

3. **Activity**

   - Contains course sections/modules
   - Links to sub-activities

4. **SubActivity**

   - Individual lessons/videos
   - Used to calculate total lessons count

5. **studentProgress**
   - Tracks which sub-activities are completed
   - Key fields: `isCompleted`, `completedAt`
   - Used to calculate course progress percentage

---

## Progress Calculation Logic

```typescript
// For each course:
totalSubActivities = sum of all sub-activities across all activities

completedSubActivities = count of studentProgress records where:
  - courseId matches
  - isCompleted = true

progressPercentage = (completedSubActivities / totalSubActivities) × 100

// Course categorization:
if (progress === 100) → completedCourses++
if (0 < progress < 100) → coursesInProgress++
if (progress === 0) → not started
```

---

## UI Component Structure

```
Dashboard Page (Server Component)
├── PageHeader
│   └── Welcome message with user name
│
├── Stats Grid (3 columns)
│   ├── StatCard - Courses in Progress
│   ├── StatCard - Completed Courses
│   └── StatCard - Certificates Earned
│
└── Main Content Grid (2 columns on lg screens)
    ├── Course Progress Chart (2/3 width)
    │   └── DashboardChart (Client Component)
    │       └── Recharts Bar Chart
    │
    └── Continue Learning (1/3 width)
        └── ContinueLearningList (Client Component)
            └── Course Cards with Progress Bars
```

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Data Fetching:**

   ```typescript
   const [stats, graphData, continueLearning] = await Promise.all([
     getDashboardData(),
     getGraphData(),
     getContinueLearning(),
   ]);
   ```

2. **Server-Side Rendering:**

   - Main page is a server component
   - Reduces client-side JavaScript
   - Faster initial page load

3. **Selective Client Components:**

   - Only chart and interactive lists are client components
   - Minimizes hydration overhead

4. **Efficient Database Queries:**
   - Uses Prisma's `select` to fetch only needed fields
   - Includes related data in single queries (reduces N+1 queries)

---

## Bilingual Support

All text content supports both English (`en`) and Amharic (`am`):

| English                    | Amharic          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Welcome back               | እንኳን በደህና መጡ     |
| Courses in Progress        | በሂደት ላይ ያሉ ኮርሶች  |
| Completed Courses          | የተጠናቀቁ ኮርሶች      |
| Certificates Earned        | የተገኙ የምስክር ወረቀቶች |
| Continue Learning          | መማርዎን ይቀጥሉ       |
| Pick up where you left off | ያቆሙበትን ቦታ ይቀጥሉ   |
| lessons completed          | ትምህርቶች ተጠናቅቀዋል   |

---

## Error Handling

All functions include try-catch blocks:

- Returns `null` on error
- Logs errors to console for debugging
- UI components handle null/empty data gracefully
- Shows appropriate empty states

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

1. **Trend Analytics:** Show progress over time
2. **Leaderboard:** Compare progress with peers
3. **Achievements/Badges:** Gamification elements
4. **Learning Streak:** Track consecutive days of learning
5. **Time Tracking:** Hours spent per course
6. **Quiz Performance:** Average scores on assessments
7. **Upcoming Deadlines:** If courses have due dates

import {
  getDashboardData,
  getGraphData,
  getContinueLearning,
} from "@/actions/student/dashboard";

// Get dashboard statistics
const stats = await getDashboardData();
// Returns: { totalCourses: 5, coursesInProgress: 2, completedCourses: 3, certificatesEarned: 2 }

// Get course progress for charts
const graphData = await getGraphData();
// Returns array of courses with progress percentages

// Get courses to continue
const continueList = await getContinueLearning();
// Returns only courses with 0 < progress < 100
```

## Related Files Updated

### `lib/data/course.ts`

Updated `getCoursesForLoginCustomer()` to include courses with unpaid orders:

- Now shows courses where user has unpaid orders
- Allows students to complete payment for partially enrolled courses
- Only excludes courses with paid status

**Logic Change:**

```typescript
// Before: Excluded ALL orders
const userOrders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: { userId: session.user.id },
});

// After: Exclude only PAID orders
const userOrders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: session.user.id,
    status: { not: "unpaid" },
  },
});
```

✅ Real-time data from database
✅ Accurate progress tracking
